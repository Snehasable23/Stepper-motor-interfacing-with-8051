# stepper-motor-interfacing-with-8051
Stepper motor interfacing with 8051 is done using both of assembly code, C language at Proteus platform and Keil Software.
The main Aim of the project and its circuits is to rotate the stepper motor step wise at a particular step angle.
Stepper motor interfacing with 8051,using ULN2803, simulated in proteus 8.6, programmed by Keil Software.
